Datac is a work-in-progress database configuration management tool. Target is to provide a solution which allows you managing your database changes as you manage your source code: via version control.

Datac aims to provide you a convenient web user interface for managing various instances and versions of databases based on Liquibase. You will be able to deploy changes to various stages, compare them and generate ready-to-run SQL files.
